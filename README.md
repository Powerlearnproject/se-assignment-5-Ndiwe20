Click on your extention tab, search for prettier code formatter. Version 9.1.0. Go ahead and click install.And set it as your code formatter.
You can also choose a theme of your choice.
4. User Interface Overview:
   - Explain the main components of the VS Code user interface. Identify and describe the purpose of the Activity Bar, Side Bar, Editor Group, and Status Bar.
a. Activity Bar: The Activity Bar is located on the far left side of the VS Code window. It contains several icons that represent different views and areas within the editor. These icons provide quick access to features like Explorer (file system view), Search, Source Control, Run and Debug, and Extensions. Users can click on these icons to switch between different functionalities of VS Code.

b. Side Bar: The Side Bar is located next to the Activity Bar on the left side of the editor. It typically contains the Explorer, Search, Source Control, and Extensions views. The Explorer view allows users to navigate and manage files and folders in the workspace. The Search view provides search functionality within the project. The Source Control view allows users to interact with version control systems like Git. The Extensions view allows users to manage installed extensions and install new ones.

c. Editor Group: The Editor Group is the central area of the VS Code window where users can open and work on files. Multiple files can be opened in editor tabs within the Editor Group, and users can switch between them easily. Users can also split the Editor Group into multiple columns or rows to view and edit files side by side.

d. Status Bar: The Status Bar is located at the bottom of the VS Code window. It provides information and quick actions related to the current workspace and file. The Status Bar displays the current cursor position, file encoding, line endings, language mode, and Git branch information if the project is under version control. It also includes buttons for changing the editor layout, selecting the language mode, and configuring other settings related to the editor.

These components work together to provide users with a comprehensive and customizable interface for coding and managing projects in Visual Studio Code.


5. Command Palette:

Some common tasks that can be performed using the Command Palette in VS Code include:

a. Opening and searching for files: You can quickly open or search for files within the workspace by typing `File: Open File` or `File: Open Folder` in the Command Palette.

b. Running commands: You can run various commands and features by typing keywords related to the action you want to perform. For example, you can type `Run Task` to run a task defined in the workspace configuration.

c. Installing and managing extensions: You can search for, install, update, disable, or remove extensions by typing `Extensions: Install Extensions` or similar commands in the Command Palette.

d. Changing settings: You can access and modify settings in VS Code by typing `Preferences: Open Settings` in the Command Palette. This allows you to customize your editor experience.

e. Running Git commands: You can use the Command Palette to run Git commands like `Git: Add`, `Git: Commit`, `Git: Pull`, `Git: Push`, and more, for managing version control within your project.

Overall, the Command Palette is a versatile tool in VS Code that helps users efficiently navigate, access, and utilize various features and commands available in the editor.

6. Extensions in VS Code:
   - Discuss the role of extensions in VS Code. How can users find, install, and manage extensions? Provide examples of essential extensions for web development.
Extensions play a crucial role in VS Code by extending its functionality and allowing users to customize their development environment according to their needs. These extensions can provide additional features, language support, tools, themes, and integrations with external services.

Users can find, install, and manage extensions in VS Code through the following steps:

a. **Finding Extensions**: Users can browse and search for extensions directly within VS Code by clicking on the Extensions view icon in the Activity Bar or using the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X`) to open the Extensions view. They can search for specific extensions using keywords and filter results based on categories like Popular, Recommended, Themes, Language Packs, etc.

b. **Installing Extensions**: Once users find an extension they want to install, they can simply click the Install button next to the extension in the Extensions view. The extension will be downloaded and installed into VS Code.

c. **Managing Extensions**: Users can manage their installed extensions by accessing the Extensions view. From there, they can enable, disable, update, uninstall, or configure extensions. Users can also adjust extension settings and explore more information about each extension.

Examples of essential extensions for web development in VS Code include:

a. **Live Server**: This extension allows users to launch a local development server with live reload capabilities. It's useful for quickly previewing and testing web projects.

b. **ESLint**: A popular extension for JavaScript development that provides real-time linting and code quality feedback based on ESLint rules.

c. **Prettier - Code formatter**: This extension formats code automatically to follow consistent styling rules, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

d. **Path Intellisense**: This extension offers autocompletion for file paths in import statements and file references, making it easier to navigate and reference files in the project.

e. **Debugger for Chrome**: Enables users to debug JavaScript code directly within the Google Chrome browser from VS Code, allowing for efficient debugging of web applications.
